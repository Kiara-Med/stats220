# STATS 220

## The purpose of this repository is to display the work needed for part a of assignment 1 for my STATS 220 course.

The aim of part a is to create an original meme using **all** the concepts that was used in *Module 1 and in labs 1 and 2* of the course.

#### The concepts used in this module are:
1. The usage of the R package [magick](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/magick/index.html) and using functions within this package such as ```image_append()```
2. The usage of vectors
3. The usage of pipes ```%>%``` and named objects ``` meme <- ```
#### This repository includes:

1. an index.md file that contains **all** of the information on how I created the meme. This includes:
    * The inspiration for my meme
    * The photos and links to the photos that I used to create the meme
    * The R code that I wrote to create the meme
    
2. The png file of the meme (of which we can see below)
